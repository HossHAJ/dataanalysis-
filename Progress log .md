### 13th March:
 
- Houcem: Started working on the second visualization, focusing on structuring the data and preparing the graphical representation.
- Maximilien: Creating the First visualization.
- Lina: Making the structure of the different HTML pages + styling them with CSS + creating the README file on HTML.
 
### 15th March:
 
- Houcem: Continued refining and improving the second visualization, adding interactivity and ensuring correct data representation.
- Maximilien: Creating the First visualization.
- Lina: Creating the Third Visualisation.
 
### 16th March:
 
- Houcem: Debugged and added interpretations to the second visualization.
          Debugged issues across all pages to ensure smooth functionality.
- Maximilien: Creating the First visualization.
- Lina: Creating the Third Visualization.
 
### 19th March:
 
- Houcem: Created the fourth visualization, ensuring meaningful insights from the dataset.
- Maximilien: Creating the Fifth visualization.
- Lina: Creating the Third Visualization + Making the interpretations for the graphs and styling the website.
 
### 21st March:
 
- Houcem: Improved the fourth visualization, adding new interactive features to enhance user experience.
          Styled the navigation bar for better usability.
- Maximilien: Creating the Fifth visualization + managing some buggs with the D3.js visualizations on the js pages + styling the website.
- Lina: Managing some buggs with the Third visualization on the js page + Making the interpretation for the graphs + adding some features on the HTML pages.
 
### 22nd March:
 
- Houcem: Worked on the scoping document, detailing the project's scope, objectives, and methodology
- Maximilien: Making the interpretation for the 4th and 5th graphs.
- Lina: Changing the 3rd visualization (from a horizontal bar chart to a bubble chart), styling the bubble chart in order to have more interactive features.
 
### 23rd March:
 
- Houcem: Created a "Ready to Buy" button on all pages, allowing users to quickly navigate to the footer section where they can proceed with the purchase after selecting a car.
- Maximilien: Changing the 5th visualization, because the last one had some buggs and didn't represent well the website.
- Lina: Making the interpretation of the 3rd graph + Finishing the 3rd graph + Managing some buggs with the interactive features of this visualization.
 
### 26th March:
