 # ** Data Sources & Processing**

## ** Dataset Selection**
We are using **the "mars-2014-complete.csv" dataset**, which contains detailed information about various car models, including:  
- **Brand (Manufacturer)**  
- **Maximum Power (HP)**  
- **Fuel Consumption (L/100km)**  
- **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (g/km)**  

This dataset is crucial for analyzing vehicle sustainability by comparing power, efficiency, and environmental impact.

## **‚úÖ Strengths & ‚ùå Limitations of the Dataset**  
### **Strengths:**  
- **Comprehensive:** Covers multiple vehicle brands and models.  
- **Relevant Variables:** Includes **power, fuel consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions**, essential for evaluating sustainability.  
- **Structured Format:** Available in **CSV**, making it easy to process with Python, Pandas, and D3.js.  

### **Limitations:**  
- **Missing Data:** Some vehicles have **incomplete or missing fields** (e.g., missing power or CO‚ÇÇ values).  
  
- **Inconsistent Formatting:** Some values may have **different units** or **extra spaces**, requiring cleaning.  

---

## **Backup Plan if Data is Unavailable**  
If the dataset is incomplete or missing, we plan to:  
 
- **Manually fill gaps** by referencing manufacturer specifications where possible.  

---

## **Data Type & Format**  
- The dataset is in **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** format.  
- This is an **unstructured format**, but it is easy to parse and process using Python's **Pandas** library.  

---

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning**  
To ensure high-quality visualization, we performed **EDA** :

### **1 Handling Missing Values**  
- **Dropped rows** with completely missing key parameters (Power, CO‚ÇÇ, Fuel Consumption).  

### **2Ô∏è Standardizing Units**  
- Converted any **inconsistent numerical values** to standard units .  

### **3Ô∏è Filtering Data**  
- We only include **specific manufacturers** for clarity:  
  **Suzuki, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Renault, Alfa Romeo, Chevrolet, Fiat, Ferrari, Volvo, Nissan, BMW, Lexus**.  

### **4Ô∏è Detecting Outliers**  
- Used **box plots and histograms** to identify abnormal CO‚ÇÇ or power values.  
- **Removed extreme outliers** that were likely errors .
