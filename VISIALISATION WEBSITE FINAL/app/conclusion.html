    <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
         What is the least polluting car brand?
      </p>
      <h2>
        First Graph
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the first graph, we have seen that EH (Ethanol/bio-ethanol) is the gas that is the cleanest beause it produces 1.55 kg COâ‚‚ per liter which
        is quite small. The graph indicates that the car brand with the most EH-powered cars is lotus.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Second Graph
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the second graph, we can notice that Lexus has a big fuel consumption. That's because the Lexus's that we have are sportive. 
        For instance,  the mythical Lexus LFA has a V10 engine of 563hp. To conclude, it seems that Lexus is not the cleanest brand because even if 
        their consumption is the cleanest, the cars are too powerful. 
        Now if we look at this graph, at the brand which has the less CO2 emissions, it's clearly FIAT with 104g/km and in second position it is MERCEDES with 112 g/km.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Third Graph
      </h2>
      <p>
        On this graph, we can compare the consumption of the different car brands. So we can compare MERCEDES and FIAT. 
        Another time, it is FIAT which wins with a total consumption of 5399999963.2 L/100km compared to MERCEDES which has 5879212736.7 L/100km.
        If we take a look at Lexus which was our precedent choice, we can notice that even if the brand has only 11 cars the bubble is as big as MERCEDES, 
        which means that its consumption is really high (because Lexus has only 11 cars and Mercedes has much more cars).
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Fourth Graph
      </h2>
      <p>
        On this graph, we can see that the formed triangle with FIAT is very small compared to all the other car brands. That means that we have chosen the good one.
        If we select MERCEDES for example, we can notice that it is much bigger, that means that the 3 variables are much higher for MERCEDES. One thing is very interesting
        for MERCEDES, it has a low power but a high consumption and a high C02 emission. It shows that even if the MERCEDES cars are not powerful, they are polluting a lot. 
        It can come from the type of consumption which is GO in majority (cf graph 1), it is a highly polluting fuel.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Fifth Graph
      </h2>
      <p>
        Finally, on this graph we can see that CO2 emissions and car weight are often related. Indeed, the lighter the car is, the less co2 it emits. 
        A Fiat 500 (which was the model on graph 2) weighs around 980 kg. On the graph, we can see that cars weighing less than 1000 kg are the least polluting.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Conclusion:
      </h2>
      <p>
        To conclude, FIAT is the cleanest brand of our dataset because most of its cars are really light, aren't powerful, and have a small consumption.
