# Run Your Website from VS Code  

## 1. Download and Extract the Project  
- Go to **GitHub** and open the project repository.  
- Click on the green **Code** button, then select **Download ZIP**.  
- Extract the downloaded ZIP folder.  
- Navigate to the **visualisation_website_final** folder.  

⚠️ If you open **index.html** directly by double-clicking it, the D3.js graphs may not display correctly due to local file loading restrictions.  

## 2. Install Required Extensions  
- Open **VS Code** and go to the **Extensions** tab (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).  
- Install **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey) for automatic page refresh.  

## 3. Open Your Project  
- Open **VS Code** and click **File > Open Folder**.  
- Select the **visualisation_website_final** folder.  

## 4. Launch the Website  
- Open the **index.html** file in VS Code.  
- Right-click and select **Open with Live Server**.  
- Your browser will open with the website running locally, and the D3.js graphs should now display correctly.
